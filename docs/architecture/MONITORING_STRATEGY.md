# SharePoint Webhook Solution Monitoring Strategy

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Monitoring (Immediate)
1. **Deploy health check endpoint**
   - Run every 5 minutes via external monitor (Azure Monitor, Pingdom, etc.)
   - Alert on any non-200 response
   - Check critical components: webhooks, storage, SharePoint API

2. **Set up Azure Application Insights**
   ```javascript
   // Add to all functions
   const appInsights = require('applicationinsights');
   appInsights.setup(process.env.APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY);
   appInsights.start();
   ```

3. **Create monitoring dashboard**
   - Deploy the monitoring-dashboard function
   - Bookmark URL for quick access
   - Check daily during initial rollout

### Phase 2: Metrics & Analytics (Week 1-2)
1. **Implement metrics collection**
   - Deploy MetricsCollector to all notification handlers
   - Track every notification, forward, and error
   - Store in Azure Table Storage for 30 days

2. **Create alerting rules in Azure Monitor**
   - Webhook expiring within 12 hours → Critical
   - Forwarding error rate > 10% → Warning
   - No notifications received in 6 hours → Information
   - Function execution time > 5 seconds → Warning

3. **Build operational reports**
   - Daily summary email
   - Weekly trend analysis
   - Monthly capacity planning

### Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring (Month 1-2)
1. **Implement distributed tracing**
   - Track notification flow from receipt to forward
   - Identify bottlenecks and failures
   - Correlate errors across components

2. **Add predictive monitoring**
   - Detect anomalies in notification patterns
   - Predict webhook expiration issues
   - Identify trending error patterns

3. **Create runbooks**
   - Automated response to common issues
   - Self-healing for transient failures
   - Escalation procedures

## Key Metrics to Track

### SLI (Service Level Indicators)
1. **Availability**: % of time webhook handler responds successfully
2. **Latency**: Time from notification receipt to forward completion
3. **Error Rate**: % of failed forwards
4. **Freshness**: Age of oldest unrenewed webhook

### SLO (Service Level Objectives)
- 99.5% availability (allows 3.6 hours downtime/month)
- 95% of forwards complete within 2 seconds
- < 1% error rate for forwarding
- All webhooks renewed at least 24 hours before expiry

## Alerting Configuration

### Critical Alerts (Page immediately)
```yaml
- name: Webhook Handler Down
  condition: health_check.status != 200 for 5 minutes
  
- name: High Error Rate
  condition: forwarding.error_rate > 25% for 10 minutes
  
- name: Webhooks Expiring
  condition: webhooks.expiring_soon > 0 AND time_to_expiry < 6 hours
```

### Warning Alerts (Email/Teams)
```yaml
- name: Degraded Performance
  condition: forwarding.p95_latency > 5000ms for 15 minutes
  
- name: Storage Issues
  condition: storage.write_failures > 5 in 5 minutes
  
- name: Unusual Activity
  condition: notifications.rate > 2x baseline for 30 minutes
```

## Dashboard Setup

### Azure Monitor Dashboard
1. **Overview Panel**
   - Current health status
   - Active webhook count
   - 24h notification volume
   - Current error rate

2. **Performance Panel**
   - Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
   - Request rate over time
   - Error rate trend
   - Cold start frequency

3. **Business Metrics Panel**
   - Notifications by SharePoint site
   - Forwards by destination
   - Success rate by hour
   - Top error types

### PowerBI Report (Optional)
- Weekly executive summary
- Site-specific webhook analytics
- Cost analysis and optimization
- Capacity planning projections

## Operational Procedures

### Daily Checks (5 minutes)
1. Check monitoring dashboard
2. Review any overnight alerts
3. Verify all webhooks active
4. Check error rates

### Weekly Review (30 minutes)
1. Analyze trends and patterns
2. Review error logs for systemic issues
3. Update runbooks based on incidents
4. Plan any necessary optimizations

### Monthly Planning (2 hours)
1. Capacity review and forecasting
2. Cost optimization analysis
3. Architecture improvements
4. Stakeholder reporting

## Integration Points

### Azure DevOps
- Link deployments to metrics
- Track error rates after releases
- Automated rollback triggers

### Microsoft Teams
- Alert channel for warnings
- Daily summary bot
- Incident management workflow

### ServiceNow (if applicable)
- Auto-create incidents for critical alerts
- Track MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)
- Knowledge base integration

## Cost Considerations

### Estimated Monthly Costs
- Application Insights: ~$50-100
- Azure Monitor alerts: ~$10
- Log Analytics workspace: ~$50-150
- Dashboard queries: ~$5

### Optimization Tips
1. Use sampling for high-volume metrics
2. Implement log level filtering
3. Archive old metrics to blob storage
4. Use Azure Monitor workbooks for complex queries

## Success Metrics

After 3 months, you should have:
- < 1 hour MTTR for incidents
- > 99.5% availability achieved
- < 5 manual interventions per month
- Predictive alerts preventing 80% of issues

This monitoring strategy will transform your webhook solution from reactive to proactive, ensuring reliable operation at scale.
